		    <p style="font-family: Montserrat;">Because of how we live and work now most people are feeling overwhelmed by content, </br>drowned in data, and yet starved for meaning. 
		    	It can leave many of us feeling as though our daily lives are like a human pinball game, with us bouncing off whatever we happen to come across at any given moment or day. 
		    	</br>This reactive way of getting through our lives can leave us feeling disconnected from any sense of larger meaning or higher purpose. 
		    </br>And the things about us human beings is: we really want things to be meaningful. Especially our lives.

				MeaningfulObstacles.com is a process and tool that helps you “come to know the deeper mythic resonances that make up your life”,</br> so that you can “creatively convert” that knowledge into more powerful and more meaningful experiences.

	   		    	<p style="font-family: Montserrat;">
	   		    	By harnessing the inherent power of stories and story structure.</br>
				As a species, story and storytelling is our oldest technology for gaining knowledge and making meaning. So much so that stories are an integral part of what makes us who we are.  There is even a theory that one of our most significant evolutionary leaps was due to our ability to come up with and agree to a common fiction!  
				</br></br>(If you would like to learn more about this and similar ideas we recommend reading SAPIENS by Yuval Harari and THE STORYTELLING ANIMAL by Jonathan Gottschall)
				</br>In short, we are so wired for stories that most of us, 
				moment by moment and day by day, without needing to think about it or even try, 
				</br>make sense of the world by creating stories about what happens around us. 
				And the manner in which you do that as an individual, 
				</br>and the kinds of stories you are drawn to and enjoy, can be extraordinarily revealing and deeply insightful.
